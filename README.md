# NameAndMetadataChanger
This program takes all of the files in a folder and randomly changes the names, dates created, and other metadata of each file. Intended for special cases where all files in a folder must be randomized for business reasons.

BE VERY CAREFUL!! This program can very easily corrupt file paths. While the program does not change the file extension, the names and dates of the files will all be randomized. The names of the files will all be alphanumeric digits. This is part of a larger project, but figured I would post it here as a large amount of the heavy-lifting is done.

REQUIREMENTS:

.NET Framework 4.6 or later.
